# ChainGPT and BNB Smart Chain Olympics "Train Like a Champion" Campaign  

The 2024 Summer Olympics inspired a groundbreaking collaboration between ChainGPT and BNB Smart Chain, merging blockchain technology with AI-driven innovation through the "Train Like a Champion" campaign. This initiative not only celebrated the Olympic spirit but also demonstrated how decentralized ecosystems can create immersive, reward-based experiences. With over 30,000 participants and $250,000 in prizes, the campaign solidified ChainGPTâ€™s role as a leader in AI-powered blockchain solutions.  

## Partnership Overview  

From July 24 to August 14, 2024, the "Train Like a Champion" campaign united key players in the BNB Chain ecosystem to deliver a gamified experience centered on engagement and education. Participants interacted with decentralized applications (dApps) across DeFi, GameFi, and NFT sectors, earning experience points (XP) to enhance Olympic-themed AI NFTs. These NFTs, co-created with ChainGPT, Limewire, and NFPrompt, served as both digital collectibles and progress trackers. Top performers climbed leaderboards to claim shares of the prize pool, showcasing the synergy between competitive spirit and blockchain innovation.  

### Campaign Structure  

The campaign featured three core challenges:  

1. **Loyalty Challenge**  
   - Encouraged consistent interaction with BNB Chain dApps.  
   - Tasks included staking tokens, completing daily check-ins, and participating in governance votes.  

2. **Champion Challenge**  
   - Focused on high-impact actions like liquidity provision and NFT trading.  
   - Required strategic use of ChainGPTâ€™s AI tools to optimize NFT evolution.  

3. **DeFi Challenge**  
   - Highlighted decentralized finance protocols such as Avalon Finance and Footballcraft.  
   - Participants earned XP by lending, borrowing, or yield farming on partnered platforms.
