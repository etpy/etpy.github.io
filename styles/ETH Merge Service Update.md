# ETH Merge Service Update  

## Understanding the Ethereum Merge  

The **Ethereum Merge** marks a historic transition from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This upgrade aims to enhance network scalability, reduce energy consumption by ~99.95%, and lay the groundwork for future innovations like sharding. The Merge occurs in two critical phases:  

1. **Bellatrix Upgrade** (September 6, 2022 UTC):  
   - Activates the Beacon Chain as the new PoS consensus layer.  
   - Prepares the network for the final execution layer transition.  

2. **Paris Upgrade** (September 15, 2022 UTC):  
   - Officially merges the Ethereum execution layer with the Beacon Chain.  
   - Shuts down the legacy PoW chain, completing the transition.

## Scenario Analysis: No Fork vs. Hard Fork  

### **Scenario A: No New Tokens**  
- **Post-Merge**: ETH and ERC-20 deposits/withdrawals resume once network stability is confirmed.  
- **Impact**: Minimal changes for users; no additional actions required.  

### **Scenario B: New PoW Tokens Created**  
- **Token Airdrop**: Forked tokens (e.g., ETHPoW) will be distributed at a 1:1 ratio to ETH holders.  
- **Trading**: Forked tokens require OKX listing approval before trading resumes.  
- **Loan Repayment**: Outstanding ETH loans must be repaid using forked tokens if a hard fork occurs.
