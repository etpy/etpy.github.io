# Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP Prices Are Down Today  

The cryptocurrency market is experiencing significant volatility as prices for major assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and XRP (XRP) decline. This pullback follows a recent surge driven by positive macroeconomic signals, including lower U.S. inflation data, strong Chinese tech earnings, and optimism about U.S.-China trade relations. However, investor caution has returned due to upcoming economic indicators like the Producer Price Index (PPI) release and a $3.1 billion crypto options expiry.  

At the time of writing, the global crypto market cap has dropped 2.24% to $3.29 trillion, with 24-hour trading volume falling 22.55% to $118.77 billion. This article explores the technical outlook for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, key support/resistance levels, and potential price trajectories.
