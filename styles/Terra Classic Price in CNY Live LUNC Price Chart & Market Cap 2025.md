## Terra Classic Fundamentals and Historical Context

### What Is Terra Classic (LUNC)?  
Terra Classic (LUNC) emerged from the rebranding of the original Terra blockchain following the 2022 collapse of its flagship stablecoin UST. This pivotal event reshaped the ecosystem, creating two distinct chains: the reborn Terra (LUNA) and Terra Classic (LUNC). The latter preserves the original protocol's legacy while implementing new mechanisms like the **1.2% burn tax** to address supply inflation.

### Key Technological Features  
- **Burn Tax Mechanism**: Every LUNC transaction incurs a 1.2% burn rate, permanently removing tokens from circulation. This deflationary strategy aims to stabilize the ecosystem and support USTC (Terra Classic's USD-pegged stablecoin).  
- **Exempt Transactions**: USTC ‚Üî LUNC swaps are tax-free to maintain liquidity efficiency.  
- **ERC-20 Compatibility**: Maintains Ethereum blockchain integration for cross-chain functionality.

### Terra Classic's Historical Significance  
The 2022 collapse marked one of crypto's most dramatic crashes:  
- LUNA's price plummeted from $116 to near-zero  
- $40 billion market value evaporated  
- Triggered regulatory scrutiny across global crypto markets  

This event underscored critical lessons for algorithmic stablecoin design and risk management in decentralized finance (DeFi).
