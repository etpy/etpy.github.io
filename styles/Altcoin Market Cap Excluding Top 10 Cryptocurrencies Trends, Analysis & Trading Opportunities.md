## Why Focus on Altcoins?  

The cryptocurrency ecosystem thrives on innovation. While Bitcoin and Ethereum serve as foundational assets, **altcoins** often pioneer niche technologies, decentralized applications (dApps), and sector-specific solutions. By excluding the top 10 cryptocurrencies, we isolate the performance of these emerging projects, revealing potential opportunities and risks.  

For example, during bull markets, altcoins frequently outperform larger cap assets due to their higher volatility and speculative appeal. Conversely, bear markets may disproportionately impact smaller projects lacking robust fundamentals.
